# Chrome-Extension-Practice

This is practice for creating web extensions (for Chrome).

Derived from the tutorial on Youtube: 'Chrome Extension Tutorial' by Codevolution. Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwg2-q6Kvw3Tl_4xhxtIaNlY.

Practice work of Mark Connelly.


## Debugging
Page-action/browser-action:
- Right-click on icon > Inspect Popup

Background/event page:
- chrome://extensions > Inspect views background page

Content Scripts:
- From the given webpage


We can set break points in the Sources tab and inspect variable values.


## Deployment
Go to chrome developer dashboard. 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard?pli=1  
You then need to pay $5 to put your extension on the store for Chrome OS only. (Not available to Windows, Mac or Linux)  
So basically, I don't see the point in doing this.

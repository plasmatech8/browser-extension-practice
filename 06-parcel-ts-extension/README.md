# Parcel ts extension

Tutorial article: [Modern Web Extension Development with TypeScript](https://areknawo.com/modern-web-extension-development-with-typescript/)

Parcel bundler: https://parceljs.org/


Parcel could be really good because it is simple and convenient!
* Autoreloads with dev mode command `parcel <files> ...`
* Builds with build command `parcel build <files> ...`
* Automatically handles TypeScript, SCSS, etc, from the html files.
* Allows node_modules imports

Although, for browser extensions, you will still need to build and refresh in the debug.

To look into:
* snowpack
* webextension-polyfill
